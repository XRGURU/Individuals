## My Topics
<p align="justify">
You can access AR/VR digital content on your device through My Topics. While some content is available for free, you will need to purchase packages from our Marketplace. A package can be purchased in the marketplace by individuals or institutions.

Users must first log into the XR Guru app for Oculus, iOS, or Android to view all of their subscribed packages.
